1) Which of the following condition is used to transmit two packets over a medium at the same time?
A.Contention
B. Collision
C. Synchronous
D.Asynchronous
E. None of the above
Explanation: Collision is the result of two devices attempting to transmit data at the same time
2) In full duplex data transmission, both the sender and the receiver
A.cannot talk at once
B. can receive and send data simultaneously
C. can send or receive data one at a time
D.can do one way data transmission only
E. None of the above
Explanation: full-duplex (FDX), or sometimes double-duplex system, allows communication in both
directions
3) Which of the following TCP/IP protocol is used for transferring electronic mail messages from one
machine to another?
A.FTP
B. SNMP
C.SMTP
D.RPC
E. None of the above
Explanation: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
4) Which of the following device is used to connect two systems, especially if the systems use different
protocols?
A.hub
B. bridge
C.gateway
D.repeater
E. None of the above
Explanation: All others require same protocol
5) A distributed network configuration in which all data/information pass through a central computer is
A.bus network
B. star network
C. ring network
D.Point-to-point network
E. None of the above
Explanation: The topology where the central node is responsible from transmission is star topology.
6) What part of 192.168.10.51 is the Network ID, assuming a default subnet mask?
A.192
B. 192.168.10
C. 0.0.0.5
D.51
E. None of the above
Explanation: This is a class C address default form is N.N.N.H
7) In CRC there is no error if the remainder at the receiver is _____.
A.equal to the remainder at the sender
B. zero
C. nonzero
D.the quotient at the sender
Explanation: The protocol assumes error free transmission if the remainder is zero
8) Usually, it takes 10-bits to represent one character. How many characters can be transmitted at a
speed of 1200 BPS in a second?
A.10
B. 12
C.120
D.1200
E. None of the above
Explanation: 1200/10=120
